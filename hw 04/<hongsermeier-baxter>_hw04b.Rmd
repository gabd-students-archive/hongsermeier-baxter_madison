```{r}
library("tidyverse")
```

Plot 1

    Plot type: scatterplot
    Dataset: trees
    x-axis: height
    y-axis: girth

#### Plot 1

```{r}
data(trees)
```

```{r}
?trees
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = trees) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Height, y = Girth))
```

Plot 2

Apply some of your skills that you learned during Assignment 02. You will make two vectors, then combine them into a data frame for plotting. Review the assignments if necessary.

    Make a vector called year for 1821 to 1934. Rememeber how to use : to make a sequence of numbers?

    Look at the class() of the lynx dataset. The lynx dataset is a “time series” class (ts). You can convert the time series data to a vector by using the as.vector() function. Just put the dataset name inside the parentheses. Assign this to the variable pelts.

    Make a dataframe called lynx_pelts from these two vectors.
    Plot type: linegraph
    Dataset: lynx_pelts (see above)
    x-axis: year
    y-axis: pelts

    Make the line color maroon. Maroon is one of the default R colors.

#### Plot 2

```{r}
data(lynx)
```

```{r}
?lynx
```

```{r}
year <- 1821:1934
```

```{r}
class(lynx)
```

```{r}
pelts <- as.vector(lynx)
```

```{r}
lynx_pelts <- data.frame(year, pelts)
```

```{r}
lynx_pelts
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = lynx_pelts) + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = year, y = pelts), color = "maroon")
```

Plot 3

    Plot type: scatterplot
    Dataset: iris
    x-axis: petal length
    y-axis: petal width
    Point color and shape by species. You do not have to use fillable shapes.
    Point size of 2
    Add a labs layer to change the x- and y-axis labels so that they do not have periods in the names (i.e., Petal Length, Petal Width).

#### Plot 3

```{r}
data(iris)
```

```{r}
?iris
```

Plots 4 and 5

    This requires two code chunks, which will be nearly identical
    Plot type: Violin plot (look up geom_violin)
    Dataset: msleep
    x-axis: vore
    y-axis: sleep_rem
    fill = grayXX where XX is either 30 or 70.

    In your description, describe in your own words what violin plots display (you can search the interwebs), and what is the difference among the two versions of gray shading. Hint: the grays extend from gray0 to gray100. You can learn more about colors in R from this PDF file.

#### Plot 4 and 5

```{r}
data(msleep)
```

```{r}
?msleep
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep) + 
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(x = vore, y = sleep_rem), fill = "gray30")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep) + 
  geom_violin(mapping = aes(x = vore, y = sleep_rem), fill = "gray70")
```

Plot 7

    Plot type: boxplot
    Dataset: msleep
    x-axis: order
    y-axis: sleep_total
    use coord_flip()

#### Plot 7

```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = order, y = sleep_total))

ggplot(data = msleep) + 
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = order, y = sleep_total)) +
  coord_flip()
```


Plot 8

    Plot type: boxplot with points
    Dataset: msleep
    x-axis: conservation
    y-axis: awake
    You must have a boxplot layer, a point layer, and a jitter layer.
    color by conservation status.
    You may use coord_flip but it is not required. Try both and choose the one you think looks best.
    Add a lab layer to change both axis labels so each starts with an upper-case letter.
    Search the internet to find out how to change the legend title to Conservation. Make that change. (Do not try to change the actual legend entries like “cd” and “vu”). Note: This can be done a couple of different ways but scale_color_discrete() is one good way.

#### Plot 8

```{r}
ggplot(data = msleep, mapping = aes(x = conservation, y = awake, color = conservation)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_jitter() +
  labs(x = "Conservation", y = "Awake") +
  labs(color= "Conservation")  
```

Plots 9 and 10.

    Make two scatterplots of your choice, with the following constraints.
    One should plot any one of the “sleep” or “awake” variables against body weight. The other should plot any one of the “sleep” or “awake” variables against brain weight.
    In each plot, color the points by one of the nominal data categories. Use a different category for each plot.
    Apply facet_wrap() to at least one of the plots using one of the nominal variables. You decide whether you use 2 or 3 columns. Hint: use one of the nominal variables with relatively few different types for wrapping. Explore: What happens if you use a nominal variable like genus, with lots of types?
    You should try a few versions of each graph until you find combinations that you think show some clear trends.

#### Plot 9 and 10

```{r}

```

  
    
    
    

    The first time you use a dataset, load it with the command data(dataset name) in your code chunk. For example, data(faithful) loads the Old Faithful dataset. Technically, you do not have to do this but it is good coding practice. I expect that you will do this.

    After you load the dataset, and only for the first time, enter ?<dataset name> in your code chunk to see the format of the data. For example, ?faithful will give you information about the Old Faithful dataset.

    Note: You should always inspect your data visually. That is why I am asking you to do this step.

    You only need to do these two steps the first time you use a dataset.

    Run each code chunk, and write 1-2 sentences that describes any trends or patterns that you observe in the plot. In other words, think like a scientist!

    Include the #### Plot <no.> header above each plot.




    Describe the patterns or trends you see in each graph.
